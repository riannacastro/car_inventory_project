# Car Inventory

Hello! Thank you for visiting the car inventory! This web application allows you to view the current car inventory. To get started you will need to either "sign up" or "log in" using a username and secure password. Once done so, you will be able to view the list of cars, create new cars to add to the inventory, update your cars that you added to the inventory, along with delete cars that you created.

## Installation

To install it yourself:
```$ bundle install```

After installing, run the following to start the program:
```shotgun```

## Usage

Once running shotgun, go to your web browser and view the application on your local host. 

You will be prompted with a welcome page that allows you to choose between "sign up" or "log in"

If choosing sign up:
You will be asked to enter a username and a secure password. If any of the fields are left blank, your account will not be created. Please make sure all fields are filled before signing up. 
If the username is already taken, you will need to enter a unique username that is not already in use.

If choosing to sign in:
Please sign in using your correct username and password.

Once you have signed in/signed up, you will be redirected to the car inventory page with a list of all the cars. You will be able to view all of the cars by clicking on the name of the car. 

When creating a new car:
Click on "create new car" to add a car to the inventory list. You must make sure all the fields are complete in order for your car to be created. A new car will not be created if you leave any fields blank. Once you are finished, click on "create new car" to save the vehicle to the database. 

Users will be able to view cars created by other users. However, only cars created by the current user logged in will have an option to edit/delete.

When you are ready to log out, click the log out button and you will be successfully logged out.
